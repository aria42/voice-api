## Getting Started

Required [homebrew](http://brew.sh) packages:

```bash
brew install scala
brew install sbt
```

## How to run unit-tests

```bash
sbt clean test
```

## How to use an IDE

It's vastly easier to code Scala in an IDE; IntelliJ is generally considered the strongest IDE (not just for Java, Scala, 
but also for Python, TypeScript, etc.). 

In IntelliJ, import the `build.sbt` project and the rest should just work.
